## 🤝 Human Supervision Model

### Why Human-Supervised AI?
Our AI Testing Agent operates under a human supervision model to ensure:

- **Reliability**: Human oversight prevents AI errors from causing issues
- **Trust**: Users maintain control over all critical testing decisions
- **Accuracy**: Human validation improves AI learning and performance
- **Safety**: Prevents automated systems from causing unintended harm
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for AI system oversight

### How Human Supervision Works
1. **AI Suggests**: System proposes test scenarios and automation steps
2. **Human Reviews**: User validates and approves AI recommendations
3. **Controlled Execution**: Tests run with human-defined parameters
4. **Results Validation**: Human interprets results and makes decisions
5. **Learning Loop**: System improves based on human feedback

## 🌟 Example Scenarios

### E-Commerce Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: Product Purchase Flow
Given I am on the product catalog page
When I search for "wireless headphones"
And I click on the first product
And I add the item to my cart
And I proceed to checkout
And I enter valid payment information
Then I should see order confirmation
And I should receive a confirmation email
```

### Login Security Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: Login Security Validation
Given I am on the login page
When I attempt to login with invalid credentials
Then I should see appropriate error messages
And the system should log the failed attempt
And I should not be able to access protected areas
And the system should implement rate limiting
```

### API Integration Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: API Response Validation
Given the API endpoint is available
When I send a POST request with valid data
Then I should receive a 200 status code
And the response should contain expected fields
And the data should be properly formatted
And the response time should be under 2 seconds
```
